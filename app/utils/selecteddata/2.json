Uh, oil prices have been very volatile amid these recent developments in The Middle East, but I think what's most striking to me is how quickly they actually retreated from the recent highs, and they're still at lower levels than I think many people would have expected given the recent developments.

      "Transcript": "Yeah. Absolutely. So we estimate that the geopolitical risk premium in oil spiked to over $15 per barrel on on Sunday night just just a week ago. And then twenty four hour later, it was just worth only a couple of dollars per barrel based on the fact that oil prices were nearly back to pre escalation levels. And also, if you look at options markets. If you look at option markets and look at the probability of large supply disruptions, it's pretty low as estimated by options markets, below 4% or so. And the question is why is that? I think the first reason is that oil traders have now experienced several episodes with major geopolitical shocks, but actually no disruptions to oil flows, with barrels still flowing. I think the second reason is that Iran's response quite muted. Both The US and Qatar got a heads up, and there were no damages. Third, I think both The US and China have very big incentives to make sure that oil flows continue, in particular, through the Strait Of Hormuz. And President Trump, his great focus on energy affordability, in particular, is super focused on preventing those disruptions. And then last but not least, I think a lot of traders are reluctant to position for sharp price upside as they share a review that the markets will start to see large inventory builds from the fall fall onwards.",

At some point, if you looked at the polymarket prediction market, the probability of a of a disruption of the Strait Of Hormuz spiked to 60% at some point.

In practice, that means continue to invest in power, electrifying the economy, coal as well, basically boost the supply of everything that you have at home. China continues to import about two thirds of its oil consumption from the rest of the world, and about 50% of its imports are coming from The Strait.

      "Speaker": "Dan Stroivan",
      "SpeakerNumber": 2,
      "Transcript": "Yes. So the main reason we look for oil prices to drop by another $10 per barrel over the next year is that we expect strong supply growth. In fact, we expect global supply this year to grow four times more quickly than demand, assuming no disruptions, with strong supply growth basically from two buckets of countries: the OPEC plus producers that are unwinding their voluntary production cuts and then what we call non OPEC ex U. S. Shale countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Norway, Kazakhstan, that are actually raising production by 1,000,000 barrels per day between August and last month. So very rapid supply increases there. And then the and there's actually, I think, upside risk to our forecast that U. S. Shale supply will decline modestly. Our base case looks for declines because we look for lower prices. But the recent spike, I think, has allowed many producers to sell forward their production at a higher price, to hedge price risk. And when we speak to some of the producers, they are a little bit less pessimistic about the oil price outlook from their perspective than, for instance, in early April. And in fact, we got an all time high for U. S. Crude supply released earlier today for the month of April. So I think this reinforces our view that supply growth will be will be strong and will push down oil prices, you get no geopolitical supply this year. I was just",

      "Transcript": "Yes. So the heat waves we are experiencing in The US, in Europe and now in China are bullish for energy prices, both because it means higher cooling demand via AC and because it could also potentially disrupt supply of some of the refined products, for instance. It can be tough for refineries to run well with those very hot temperatures. We think that the most significant upside is in power prices, including summer peak power prices in The U. S. And to a lesser extent, it could also be positive for natural gas prices or coal prices and to a lesser extent, fuel oil, which is the part of the oil barrel that is used for cooling. We do think that U. S. Summer power markets are getting very tight. And following the blackout we saw in late April in Spain, we do think that some of the tighter U. S. Power markets, for instance, the Mid Atlantic PGM market, is at a significant risk of power price spikes and perhaps even outages. The reason is that power demand is now growing quickly, more quickly GDP, in sharp contrast with the last two decades. Data centers are part of that. And on the supply side, most of the supply growth is really coming from weather dependent supply, such as solar and wind. And we're also having a lot of coil coal retirements being scheduled.

But taking, you know, taking a step back from the seasonals, I would characterize oil demand growth as pretty modest, modest compared to history and modest compared to strong demand growth we're seeing in some of the other commodities like copper. So specifically, we expect global oil demand to grow by 600 kbd this year. That is 0.6% of the overall market. Contrast that with the 4% to 5% demand growth we're seeing in global power markets. Compare it with copper demand in China, that's up 25% year to date with surges in solar installations and electrification supporting supporting demand.

      "SpeakerNumber": 2,
      "Transcript": "Yes. I think the, you know, the big potential winner from further dollar diversification is gold. But but more broadly, I think the industrial metals could benefit from from lower rates and and a weaker weaker dollar. On gold specifically, the almost doubling in prices since 'twenty two has really been driven by central banks diversifying out of the dollar. But the next giant leap for gold markets could be if private investors who often feel like that they're over allocated to the dollar may reallocate to some extent out of out of dollar holdings into into gold. And that could be the next giant leap for for gold markets because the gold market is 200 times smaller than The U. S. S. P 500. It's 100 times smaller than The U. S. Treasury market. So you only need like a very small shift of flows into the much smaller gold market to cause very significant gold price upside. More broadly, I think to know which commodity would benefit from lower rates and a weaker dollar, I think you have to think about the drivers. Are you in a risk off environment where the dollar and and rates are weakening because parties market participants are worried about US recession or about US fiscal sustainability? Then I think gold is your winner. If you're more in a risk on environment where the dollar is perhaps weakening because of European stimulus or perhaps because you see a dovish pivot in the Fed reaction function, then we find typically that industrial metals such as copper and alloy are are the biggest winners.",

      "Speaker": "Dan Stroivan",
      "SpeakerNumber": 2,
      "Transcript": "Yes. So I think I want to distinguish between the the macro impact from higher tariffs on other things than commodities, for instance, the reciprocal tariffs on GDP, commodity demand and commodity prices and then the impact of tariffs on metals specifically. So far, I think the sort of the macro impact via weaker GDP of tariffs is still not very large based on what we can see, still manageable, perhaps because financial conditions have weathered the tariff imposition well, perhaps because trade policy uncertainty measures are normalizing, but perhaps because it's still too early to see the full effect. I think there has been a lot of front loading that may have postponed the hit from tariffs to GDP growth and therefore commodity demand. What is already very clear, though, is the impact of the tariffs on metals markets. In particular, we have a 50% tariff on steel, a 50% tariff on aluminum imports, and we expect a 25% tariff on copper market. So far, we are seeing pretty significant price increases for U. S. Steel and U. S. Alley. So these tariffs are leading to significantly higher prices. And we do think that the possibility of a 25% tariff, perhaps a 50% tariff on U. S. Copper imports, is providing opportunities for investors. Because what traders are now trying to do is they're trying to get the metal shipped into The U. S. Before the potential deadline. And that's leading to very significant tightness in the rest of the world. Inventory levels in places like China and the world, excluding The U. S, have fallen to only ten days' worth of consumption. So that's putting a lot of upward pressure on prices outside of The U. S. And so we you know, we do think that the the threat of tariffs on copper is causing price upside both in The U. S. Mechanically because people will have to pay for the tariff, but also outside of The US.",

What we have seen over the last few months is a very positive correlation between a long dated U. S. Yields, the thirty year treasury yield on the one hand, and the gold price. So periods when the market gets worried about U. S. Sustainability are periods where rates go up and the gold price rises. On defense, specifically the industrial metals should benefit. The data are a little hard to get, but a report from the defense department showed that about 5% of U. S. Copper demand is driven by the defense industry, so a sizable share, and 13% of nickel demand.
