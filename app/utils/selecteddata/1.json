"Transcript": "So, George, today we're discussing one of the biggest anxieties, I would say, about the rise of AI, which is the impact on jobs. I would say even prior to the amazing advances in the technology that we've seen over the last few years and that you and I have discussed a lot on this podcast, there have been a lot of questions about the extent to which AI will ultimately replace workers. And if that happens to a large extent, what industries, what roles will be most impacted. It's now been almost three years, though, since we've seen the launch of ChatGPT, which is very hard to believe.",

So to that end, I'm excited to welcome my colleague from Goldman Investment Research, Joseph Briggs, who leads our global economics research. He's done some really truly informative and formative work, I would say, on the economic implications of AI more broadly and certainly on this topic. Joseph, thanks for joining us.",

"Speaker": "Geroge Lee",

"Transcript": "Yeah. So when we look at adoption, we're currently tracking about nine percent of companies in the US using AI for regular production. Now, this number is probably a little bit lower than some of the, you know, more eye popping adoption rates that get picked up in the media. But the definition that we're using when we say nine percent is regular production for goods and services over the last two weeks. And I think this is the right definition to keep in mind because it's really what is going to be necessary.\n\nCompanies using AI in regular production to drive significant productivity impacts. Now, given that adoption rates are only at nine percent, it's not too surprising that we haven't seen a large impact or really any sort of meaningful impact in the overall labor market data yet.",
