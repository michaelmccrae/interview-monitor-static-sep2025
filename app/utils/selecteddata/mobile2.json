I'm Allison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges. For today's episode, I'm speaking with my colleague in Goldman Sachs Research, Dan Stroivan, co head of global commodities research and head of oil research, to talk about how recent events, notably the Middle East conflict and evolving tariff policies, are affecting the broader commodity and economic landscape. Dan, welcome back to the program.",

      "Speaker": "Alison Nathan",
      "SpeakerNumber": 1,
      "Transcript": "So let's start with oil. I think the obvious place to start. Uh, oil prices have been very volatile amid these recent developments in The Middle East, but I think what's most striking to me is how quickly they actually retreated from the recent highs, and they're still at lower levels than I think many people would have expected given the recent developments. So why is this?",

      "Speaker": "Dan Stroivan",
      "SpeakerNumber": 2,
      "Transcript": "Yeah. Absolutely. So we estimate that the geopolitical risk premium in oil spiked to over $15 per barrel on on Sunday night just just a week ago. And then twenty four hour later, it was just worth only a couple of dollars per barrel based on the fact that oil prices were nearly back to pre escalation levels. And also, if you look at options markets. If you look at option markets and look at the probability of large supply disruptions, it's pretty low as estimated by options markets, below 4% or so. And the question is why is that? I think the first reason is that oil traders have now experienced several episodes with major geopolitical shocks, but actually no disruptions to oil flows, with barrels still flowing. I think the second reason is that Iran's response quite muted. Both The US and Qatar got a heads up, and there were no damages. Third, I think both The US and China have very big incentives to make sure that oil flows continue, in particular, through the Strait Of Hormuz. And President Trump, his great focus on energy affordability, in particular, is super focused on preventing those disruptions. And then last but not least, I think a lot of traders are reluctant to position for sharp price upside as they share a review that the markets will start to see large inventory builds from the fall fall onwards.",

To be clear, our base case assumes no disruptions. But we estimate that crude could spike above $90 per barrel if Iran supply were to drop sharply and in extreme tail scenario where the state of Hormuz were to be disrupted for us on a sustained basis, oil prices could spike above $110 per barrel.

      "Transcript": "I think it was definitely scary for investors and policymakers going through it. At some point, if you looked at the polymarket prediction market, the probability of a of a disruption of the Strait Of Hormuz spiked to 60% at some point. And I do think that policymakers, especially in China, will likely double down on diversifying their supply of energy. In practice, that means continue to invest in power, electrifying the economy, coal as well, basically boost the supply of everything that you have at home. China continues to import about two thirds of its oil consumption from the rest of the world, and about 50% of its imports are coming from The Strait. So I think this is going to strengthen this this key trend of diversifying, you know, away from foreign oil and gas imports for the Chinese economy, which is bearish oil and gas, but but bullish, you know, for copper and and some of the other green green metals.",
